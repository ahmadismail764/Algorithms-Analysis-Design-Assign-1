Assignment #1 - Part [B]
Task 1: Fibonacci Series [6 Marks]
Define functions to compute the nth Fibonacci number using the below three methods.

- Implement the Fibonacci series using recursion. [2 marks]
- Implement the Fibonacci series using divide and conquer (matrix multiplication) [2 marks]
- Implement the Fibonacci series using dynamic programming.[2 marks]

Task 2: Search Algorithms [8 Marks]
Implement sequential and binary search algorithms, demonstrating both iterative and recursive
approaches.

- Sequential Search: [2 marks]
- Define a function that takes a list and a target value as input.
- Implement the sequential search iteratively.
- If the target value is found, return the index, otherwise, return an indication that
  the target is not found.
- Recursive Sequential Search:[2 marks]
- Define a recursive function that takes a list and a target value as input.
- Search recursively for the target value, if found, return the index, otherwise,
  return an indication that the target is not found.

- Binary Search [2 marks]
- Define a function that takes a sorted list and a target value as input.
- Implement the binary search iteratively.
- If the target value is found, return the index, otherwise, return an indication that
  the target is not found.
- Recursive Binary Search [2 marks]
- Define a recursive function that takes a list, a target value, low and high index as
  input.
- Search recursively for the target value, if found, return the index, otherwise,
  return an indication that the target is not found.

Task 3: Heap, Priority Queue and Heap Sort [6 Marks]

1. Implement a Heap: [2 marks]
   a. Define a class/structure for the heap.
   b. Implement methods for inserting an element and maintaining the heap property
   (heapify).
   c. Implement methods to extract the maximum and minimum from the heap.
2. Implement a Priority Queue: [2 marks]
   a. Use the heap implementation (from step 1) to build a priority queue.
   b. Define methods for inserting an element with a priority and extracting the highest
   priority element.
   c. Ensure the insertion maintains the heap property.
3. Implement Heap Sort: [2 marks]
   a. Utilize your heap implementation to sort an array.
   b. Build a max heap from the array and repeatedly extract the max element from the
   heap and rebuild it until the array is sorted.
