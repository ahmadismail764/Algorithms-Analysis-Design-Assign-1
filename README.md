# Algorithms Analysis & Design - Assignment #1
## Task 1: Fibonacci Series
Define functions to compute the nth Fibonacci number using the below three methods.

- Implement the Fibonacci series using recursion. 
- Implement the Fibonacci series using divide and conquer (matrix multiplication).
- Implement the Fibonacci series using dynamic programming.

## Task 2: Search Algorithms 
Implement sequential and binary search algorithms, demonstrating both iterative and recursive
approaches.
### Sequential Search: 
- Define a function that takes a list and a target value as input.
- Implement the sequential search iteratively.
- If the target value is found, return the index, otherwise, return an indication that
  the target is not found.
### Recursive Sequential Search:
- Define a recursive function that takes a list and a target value as input.
- Search recursively for the target value, if found, return the index, otherwise,
  return an indication that the target is not found.

### Binary Search:
- Define a function that takes a sorted list and a target value as input.
- Implement the binary search iteratively.
- If the target value is found, return the index, otherwise, return an indication that
  the target is not found.
### Recursive Binary Search:
- Define a recursive function that takes a list, a target value, low and high index as
  input.
- Search recursively for the target value, if found, return the index, otherwise,
  return an indication that the target is not found.

## Task 3: Heap, Priority Queue and Heap Sort
### 1. Implement a Heap:
   a. Define a class/structure for the heap.
   b. Implement methods for inserting an element and maintaining the heap property
   (heapify).
   c. Implement methods to extract the maximum and minimum from the heap.
### 2. Implement a Priority Queue:
   a. Use the heap implementation (from step 1) to build a priority queue.
   b. Define methods for inserting an element with a priority and extracting the highest
   priority element.
   c. Ensure the insertion maintains the heap property.
### 3. Implement Heap Sort:
   a. Utilize your heap implementation to sort an array.
   b. Build a max heap from the array and repeatedly extract the max element from the
   heap and rebuild it until the array is sorted.
